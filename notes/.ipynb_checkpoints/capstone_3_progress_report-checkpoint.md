1. Do you have data fully in-hand, and if not, what blockers are you facing?

Blockers: 
- Original research data: check
- Open Payment 2016 & 2017: check
- MPOS 2016 & 2017: through API
- NPI registry: through API
- Gallop poll: behind paywall

2. Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?

Nope

3. What blockers am I facing?

I understand how to use R (mostly). I can read and understand what the R code is doing. Now, I need to download the datasets and perform EDA to make them match the research.
